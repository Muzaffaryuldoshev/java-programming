### Variable

Variable - named container for a particular type of date used to hold a value
Declaring variable - variable must be declared before use to seperate space in memory based on date type.

### Date Types

Date Types - define the kind of values that variables can hold
And they are divided into two parts Primitive and Non - Primitive

#### Primtiive Date Types

Java has 8 primitive data types used to store simple values:

- `byte` (1 byte)(-127 to 127) and `short` (2 bytes) are small integers.
- `int` (4 bytes) and `long` (8 bytes) store larger whole numbers.
- `float` (4 bytes) and `double` (8 bytes) are for decimal numbers, with `double` being more precise.
- `char` (2 bytes) holds a single character, like `'A'`.
- `boolean` represents `true` or `false` values, commonly used in conditions and logic.

These primitive types are the building blocks for variables and operations in Java.

## Java Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

Non-primitive data types, also called reference types, are used to store objects and more complex data.
Unlike primitives, they **store references (addresses) to the actual data** rather than the value itself.

Common non-primitive types in Java include:

- `String` – for text, e.g., `"Hello World"`.
- Arrays – to store multiple values of the same type, e.g., `int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3}`.
- Classes and Objects – custom types that are created to represent real-world entities.
- Interfaces – define a contract that classes can implement.
